            <p class="main-text">L'Ambroisie is a traditional French restaurant in Paris, France founded by Bernard Pacaud and
                now run by his son Mathieu that has maintained three Michelin stars for more than thirty
                years. The name "L'Ambroisie" ("Ambrosia" in English) comes from Greek mythology and means
                both "food for gods" and "source of immortality."
                <br>
                <br>
                The restaurant is in a period house on the southwestern corner of the Place des Vosges in
                Paris. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Place des Vosges was an upper-class and noble
                neighborhood.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="main-text">The Crémerie-Restaurant Polidor is a historic restaurant in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. Its
                predecessor was founded in 1845, and it has had its present name since the beginning of the 20th
                century.
                <br>
                <br>
                The interior of the restaurant is basically unchanged for over 100 years, and the style of cooking
                remains that of the late 19th century. The Polidor is located at 41, rue Monsieur-le-Prince in the
                Odéon area, near the Jardin du Luxembourg. Its name derives from the cream desserts it served in
                former decades.
